# SnakeGameQt - A Basic Game Development Tutorial with Qt C++

Welcome to the **SnakeGameQt** tutorial! This project is designed to introduce beginners to the fundamentals of game development using Qt C++. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional snake game and a better understanding of Qt's capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/download).
2. Set up Qt Creator IDE (recommended for a seamless experience).

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SnakeGameTutorial.git
cd SnakeGameTutorial
```

### Build and Run
1. Open the project in Qt Creator.
2. Configure the build kit (Qt 6.0+ is required).
3. Click the **Run** button to compile and launch the game.

## How the Game Works
- **Snake Movement**: Controlled using arrow keys.
  - `‚Üë`: Move Up
  - `‚Üì`: Move Down
  - `‚Üê`: Move Left
  - `‚Üí`: Move Right
- **Pause/Resume**: Press `P`.
- **Restart**: Press `R`.

The objective is to eat the red apples, grow the snake, and achieve the highest score without colliding with the walls or yourself.

## Project Structure
- **`main.cpp`**: Entry point for the application.
- **`snakegame.h/.cpp`**: Core game logic and rendering.
- **`README.md`**: This tutorial document.

## Exercises for Beginners
1. Change the snake's appearance using a custom image.
2. Add a feature to increase the snake's speed as the score increases.
3. Implement wrap-around walls (e.g., the snake appears on the opposite side when crossing a boundary).
4. Add sound effects for food collection and game over events.
